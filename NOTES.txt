errors:

- create a migration on the user file to add a column ==> points
- then can run user.points to get points 
- then when uploading tree set points
- can deduct points either immediately OR can deduct them later...if you do not do this immediately it is possible
to run into negative points which is not good
- ok to deduct points straight away? 
- if you make more credit available more people are going to use it / they will invest more 
- monkey brain;   

then in controller - when create is called --> 
1_ validate the form (set minimum points)
2_ does user have enough points i.e. if user.points - tree.points >=0 --> deduct the points and save the user
3_ if not then error message --> errors[:base] or errors[:add]

LOCATION: MDN using geolocation --> get.CurrentPosition --> has to go into 2 form fields; LONG/LAT
use rails geolocation -> geocoder 

write a migration and add some fields _--> FLOAT lat and FLOAT long

maps --> gmaps4rails


1. Can you use materialize and bootstrap on same app? Material Design Styling for Form
- https://codepen.io/sevilayha/pen/IdGKH --> NO CANNOT USE TOGETHER
https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/#input
try this out for now
2. building out a points system that deducts points


1. Responsive on Mobile is not working!
- without meta tag it will zoom out the website hence why it is not responsive on mobile

2.current_user.enrollments.create(course: current_course)
3. Video styling not working
4. Homepage feed build based on latest trees uploaded
--> in the controller for the file need to define variable e.g. @latest_trees 
--> model is course 
--> write a query to get the tree you want
--> rails creates two timestamps    
	t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
--> if you want the latest update; Course.all.order(updated_at: :desc).limit(3)
--> then in template; @latest_trees.each do etc
--> if you want the order descending:




1. HEROKU
- none of the pages work !
- heroku logs -t
- //heroku run rake db:setup// --> the databse had not been setup in heroku
- must run any time you create a new table 
- any time you run a migration rake db:migrate --> once ready to deploy to heroku must //heroku run rake db:migrate// 

- check image path and use an image tag instead

2. git commit -m
only files that are staged

3. Change the data type of points to integer

4. adding insert image functionality directly from a camera

5. geolocation from 2 sources

6. killall ruby --> end any existing sessions running

7. image upload from web app  <input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="camera">

8. codepen for video tool http://codepen.io/heff/pen/EarCt

9. cmd-shift-f --> to replace the breaks and then fix some padding and shiz

CURRENT ERROR:


Nice Things:

memoization:
1. if we've looked up the current_section beforehand use the value that we looked up previously
2. If we haven't looked up this section before, go into the database, look it up and also make sure to remember the value in case we need to look it up again later --> 

if @current_section == nil
  @current_section = Section.find(params[:section_id])
  @current_section
else
  @current_section
end

OR 

@current_section ||= Section.find(params[:section_id])


4. To Wrap multiple content into single link
     <%= link_to lesson_path(lesson) do %>  --> use a for loop that includes the necessary elements
              <b><%= lesson.title %></b>
              -
              <%= lesson.subtitle %>
            <% end %>
